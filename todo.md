# TODO list
* Set up testing framework (especially a good idea for the tokenizer code)
* Implement reading from $PATH
* Implement the cd and exit commands
* Add support for reading commands from a file
* Add pipes
* Add history at some point (may require re-thinking how everything is architected...)
* Add control flow statements (how the fuck...)
